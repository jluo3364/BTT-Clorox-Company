      "always wanted to try this sponge for the hype and advertising i bought one and its not all that i like that it doesnt scratch my pots but its harder to get grease off i use dawn not very flexible for edges on your tupperware took me longer to wash my dishes i went back to the usual dishwashing sponges but ill keep it for surfaces shoes fabrics cleaning\n",
      "we dont have a dish washer so its all done by hand weve tried so many different types of sponges rags and scrubbers these are the ones we return to over 26 over i love they dont hold onto moisture that leads to mildew 26 mold ive never had an issue with them smelling the main issue i have is i go thru them fast i need 1 a month before they start to break down 4 a month for a sponge can get kinda expensive\n",

      "works well but was absolutely decimated after about a month or two of normal dish washing the pink side totally fell apart may be because we were given the scrub mommy as a replacement instead of the scrub daddy though maybe the scrub mommy isnt intended for dish use a huge part of the reason i bought these is because theyre supposed to last a really long time and be sanitizable so not very impressed\n",
      "far superior to the scrub daddy in my opinion plus its pink i dont see why youd choose the scrub daddy over miss mommy the bow adds even more scrub potential to your dish washing journey just repurchased because i wore my last one down till she was a thin lifeless scrap and ill keep repurchasing until the brand itself is renamed scrub mommy in homage to this genius reinvention of the scrub daddy\n",

      "its ok but i dont like how its super hard unless u put hot water on it cause i dont reallt like hot water and i dont like when waiting for hoy water when im trying to quickly wash one dish also apparently ur supposed to change these out every two weeeks so that made me not want to use these anymore\n",
      "after years of seeing these on the market and reading such glowing reviews i finally succumbed and bought one i dont get the hype i dont find it to be very effective at scrubbing the shape and size doesnt lend itself to ease of use the positives i can find are  a its cute and b it rinses out easily thats it maybe im missing something maybe theres some magic trick i need to know but i wouldnt buy another one\n",

      "i see people using this on youtube all the time so i thought i would try it out and i was very surprised how well it cleans i use it in the kitchen inside oven door and the stovetop inside refrigerator etc and in the bathroom  toilet shower sink and the faucet and drain cover i use it dawn powerwash and comet and everything cleans up beautifully\n",

      "this product saved my relationship and made me a better man i no longer avoid doing dishes which always frustrated my partner in fact i am now excited to do them the features of this sponge allow for dexterous washing and the ability to sanitize it in the dishwasher has made this a total upgrade to any sponge i am a walmart employee and my review has not been sponsored or edited by walmart\n",
      "ive seen the hype around this sponge and thought surely it isnt as good as everyone says it is right well wrong it was that good at least for me it was i have one less reason to dread doing the dishes easier to grip two beautiful sides sincere service with a smile you already know the gist get one if youre curious like i was i will say your mileage may very if you have small cups or plates\n",

      "the sponge only lasted a week it worked amazing while it lasted dont get me wrong but fell apart in 6 days we cook a lot hence lots of pots  pans and serving trays paying the same price for a 6 pack of scotch bright sponges would have been better and more cost effective i also dont like how it reacts with dish soap i felt like i had to use more than normal with this product live and learn dont believe the hype over this product\n",
      "i see these scrub products all over and have debated getting them in the past but have never pulled the trigger the dish scrubbies weve been using the past 30 years have over the past couple years significantly decreased in quality and just arent holding up so when we saw these in the store this time we decided to give them a try the scrub daddy is not for the faint of heart i thought it would soften more than it does when wet so if you have fragile skin on your hands this probably isnt a good choice its really more robust than what we need to wash dishes or to occasionally scrub a little scorched food off a skillet that being said i do like the products durability and ease of cleaning just throw it in the dishwasher and its great for tougher jobs like cleaning burnt on spills off the enamel stove top\n",

      "so i bought this because my niece said you have to try this very skeptical at first then i got one it cleans everything without scratching or removing the coating in your pans was shocked how well this cleans your stovetop after dinner with all the baked on mess  shines up my stainless sink i waited to see if it started to stink after couple of days but did not i had to come back  get a 2nd one for the bathroom too plus who doesnt like to look down at your scrubby smiling at back at you\n",
      "ive been hearing a lot of hype about this thing ive never been one to jump on any band wagon or care about whats popular so i made a point of never buying these i didnt think there could possibly be a sponge that would be worthy of all of the praise this thing got a friend of mine had purchased a 2pack so when i asked if theyre as good as their followers thought she tossed me one and said to take it home and try it im a clean freak so i spend a lot of my life scrubbing i tested a small section of my shower because i wasnt convinced that it wouldnt scratch the surface my bright sparkling shower that looked so perfect already since it had only been a few hours since i cleaned it seemed to be getting smoother the more i scrubbed it turns out that there was deep set in soap scum that i wasnt able to feel through my gloves and was so minimal that you couldnt tell it was there with a typical scrub scour sponge basically this thing made me go back and scrub my house because i realized it wasnt as clean as i thought this breaks up dirt better than my drill cleaning attachments\n",
